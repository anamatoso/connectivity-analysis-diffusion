# Structural connectivity analysis in migraine patients

This repository provides the code used to analyse the data of migraine patients in the paper: [TBC]

## How to use 
You'll need MATLAB installed (I used the 2023a version, but older versions should  also work) as well as the NBS toolbox.

To run the code follow the following commands:
1) Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anamatoso/connectivity-analysis-diffusion
    ```
2) Open MATLAB and go into the repository (the folder you just downloaded) and run main.m in the command window of MATLAB:
    ```MATLAB
    run main.m
    ```
